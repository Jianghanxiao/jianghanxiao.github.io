          As a small researcher, I understand the confusion during the junior period. 
          Given the tons of help I received during my learning and growth process, 
          I would like to pass the passion and courage to junior students 
          and try my best to share my research insights based on your needs.

          Following <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jungao">Jun Gao</a> and 
          <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~weichiu/">Wei-Chiu Ma</a>, 
          I commit 1â€“2 hours per week (mostly on Sunday) 
          to host pro bono office hours and provide guidance, suggestions, or mentorship.
