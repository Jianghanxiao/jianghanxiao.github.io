        <h3>Pro Bono Office Hours</h3>
        <p>
          As a researcher who truly loves research, I understand the confusion and uncertainty that can arise during the early stages of one's journey. I've been fortunate to receive generous help and guidance along the way, and I hope to pass on that same encouragementâ€”to share my passion, experiences, and insights with students who are exploring their own research paths.

          Following <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jungao">Jun Gao</a> and 
          <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~weichiu/">Wei-Chiu Ma</a>, 
          I will dedicate 1-2 hours each week (usually on Sundays) to host pro bono office hours, offering guidance, feedback, or mentorship based on your interests and needs.
          If you're interested, please send me an email briefly describing your topic and your available time (including your time zone).
